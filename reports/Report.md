# Home Credit - Credit Risk Model Stability Project

## Abstract

The goal of this project is to accurately predict which clients are likely to default on their loans. Loan defaults pose significant financial risks to consumer finance providers, impacting their profitability and stability. Traditional methods of assessing default risk often rely on historical data and conventional credit scoring models, which may not fully capture the complexities of an individual's financial behavior over time. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, this project seeks to develop more reliable and robust models for predicting loan defaults.

This endeavor is crucial as it offers consumer finance providers a tool to better assess the risk associated with potential clients, leading to more informed lending decisions. Improved prediction models can help reduce the incidence of loan defaults, thereby enhancing the financial health of lending institutions. Additionally, stable and accurate risk assessments can contribute to fairer lending practices, as they are likely to identify creditworthy clients who might be overlooked by traditional methods. This project not only aims to enhance the accuracy of default predictions but also emphasizes the importance of model stability over time, ensuring that the solutions are sustainable and effective in the long run.

## Introduction

#### Data and Research Questions
Our project aims to develop a robust model for predicting loan defaults using a highly imbalanced dataset from a Kaggle competition hosted by Home Credit. This dataset includes over 1.5 million cases with a binary target variable indicating default (positive class) or no default (negative class). The data spans various financial and socio-economic features, sourced from multiple tables, with a significant imbalance (97% no default, 3% default) and a high percentage of missing values (92%). The primary research question is: Can we create a stable, accurate predictive model that effectively identifies clients likely to default on loans?

#### Importance and Research Plan
Predicting loan defaults accurately is crucial for financial institutions as it directly impacts their risk management strategies and financial stability. Improved prediction models can reduce financial losses and help institutions make more informed lending decisions, ultimately contributing to a healthier financial ecosystem. Our research plan involves a structured approach starting with data preprocessing, including extensive data cleaning and imputation methods to handle missing values. We perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and patterns within the data. We then develop baseline models and iteratively improve them using advanced techniques like SMOTE for balancing the dataset, PCA and LDA for dimensionality reduction, and LightGBM, RandomForest, SVM, Logistic Regression, XGBoost for model training. Key results include significant improvements in precision and recall metrics, demonstrating our modelâ€™s enhanced ability to identify true positive cases of loan defaults, despite the challenges posed by the dataset's imbalance and missing values.
