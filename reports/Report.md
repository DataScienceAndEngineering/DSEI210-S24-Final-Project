# Home Credit - Credit Risk Model Stability Project

## Abstract

The goal of this project is to accurately predict which clients are likely to default on their loans. Loan defaults pose significant financial risks to consumer finance providers, impacting their profitability and stability. Traditional methods of assessing default risk often rely on historical data and conventional credit scoring models, which may not fully capture the complexities of an individual's financial behavior over time. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, this project seeks to develop more reliable and robust models for predicting loan defaults.

This endeavor is crucial as it offers consumer finance providers a tool to better assess the risk associated with potential clients, leading to more informed lending decisions. Improved prediction models can help reduce the incidence of loan defaults, thereby enhancing the financial health of lending institutions. Additionally, stable and accurate risk assessments can contribute to fairer lending practices, as they are likely to identify creditworthy clients who might be overlooked by traditional methods. This project not only aims to enhance the accuracy of default predictions but also emphasizes the importance of model stability over time, ensuring that the solutions are sustainable and effective in the long run.
