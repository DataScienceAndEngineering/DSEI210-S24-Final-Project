    "# Home Credit - Credit Risk Model Stability Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to accurately predict which clients are likely to default on their loans. Loan defaults pose significant financial risks to consumer finance providers, impacting their profitability and stability. Traditional methods of assessing default risk often rely on historical data and conventional credit scoring models, which may not fully capture the complexities of an individual's financial behavior over time. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, this project seeks to develop more reliable and robust models for predicting loan defaults.\n",
    "\n",
    "This endeavor is crucial as it offers consumer finance providers a tool to better assess the risk associated with potential clients, leading to more informed lending decisions. Improved prediction models can help reduce the incidence of loan defaults, thereby enhancing the financial health of lending institutions. Additionally, stable and accurate risk assessments can contribute to fairer lending practices, as they are likely to identify creditworthy clients who might be overlooked by traditional methods. This project not only aims to enhance the accuracy of default predictions but also emphasizes the importance of model stability over time, ensuring that the solutions are sustainable and effective in the long run.\n",

    "##### Accomplishments:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ability to work with highly imbalanced data and perform different types of missing value imputations to enhance model performance:\n",
    "    A significant discovery during our investigation was the profound impact that missing value imputation had on model performance. Given that approximately 92% of our dataset contained missing values, robust imputation strategies were essential(mean and mode imputation, knn imputation, binary indicators) significantly improved the model's ability to handle incomplete data.\n",
    "    This approach not only filled the gaps in the dataset but also provided additional signals that the model could leverage to make more accurate predictions.\n",
    "2. Effectivenes of SMOTE in addressing class imbalance:\n",
    "    By generating synthetic samples for the minority class, SMOTE significantly improved the recall of the minority class predictions without overly compromising precision. This balancing act was pivotal in ensuring that the model could identify true positives more reliably. Our iterative evaluation showed a substantial increase in the recall metric, indicating that the model became much better at identifying positive instances in the imbalanced dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project aims to develop a robust model for predicting loan defaults using a highly imbalanced dataset from a Kaggle competition hosted by Home Credit. This dataset includes over 1.5 million cases with a binary target variable indicating default (positive class) or no default (negative class). The data spans various financial and socio-economic features, sourced from multiple tables, with a significant imbalance (97% no default, 3% default) and a high percentage of missing values (92%). The primary research question is: Can we create a stable, accurate predictive model that effectively identifies clients likely to default on loans?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Importance and Research Plan\n",
    "Predicting loan defaults accurately is crucial for financial institutions as it directly impacts their risk management strategies and financial stability. Improved prediction models can reduce financial losses and help institutions make more informed lending decisions, ultimately contributing to a healthier financial ecosystem.\n",
